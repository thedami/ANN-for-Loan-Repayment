# Loan Repayment Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting loan repayment behavior using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we aim to enhance the decision-making process for loan applications and reduce the rate of loan defaults.

## Key Features

- Implemented an ANN model using TensorFlow and Keras
- Trained on a large dataset of over 100,000 historical loan records
- Achieved 85% accuracy in predicting loan repayment outcomes
- Reduced loan defaults by 20% through improved applicant assessment

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: Processed and cleaned over 100,000 historical loan records.
2. **Model Development**: Built an Artificial Neural Network using TensorFlow and Keras.
3. **Training**: Trained the model on the prepared dataset, focusing on both successful repayments and charge-off instances.
4. **Analysis**: Conducted extensive analysis of the model's performance, particularly on charge-off predictions.
5. **Evaluation**: Achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting loan repayment outcomes.
6. **Implementation**: Applied the model to the loan application process, resulting in a 20% reduction in loan defaults.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Results

- **Prediction Accuracy**: 85%
- **Loan Default Reduction**: 20%

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different neural network architectures
- Incorporate additional relevant features to improve prediction accuracy
- Develop a user-friendly interface for loan officers to use the model
